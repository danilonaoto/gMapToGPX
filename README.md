#gMapToGPX
A converter from google maps routes to GPX. Originally from http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/gmaptogpx
Unfortunately I found it horribly broken (it's extremely tightly-coupled to the internal datastructures used by google maps which means that it can essentially break at any time). Looks like it's not been updated for a while.
